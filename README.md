# stm32wl_radioDriver_pingPong

An example of using the low-level Sub-GHz Phy driver in a standalone fashion. This example duplicates the high-level functionality of the SubGHz\_Phy\_PingPong example in the [STM32CubeWL MCU Package](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubewl.html). Two [NUCLEO-WL55JC1](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/NUCLEO-WL55JC1/13893870) boards are required, one of which will act as the master and the other will act as the slave. Initially, both boards are in the master state sending "PING" messages at random intervals and waiting for responses. Eventually, the two boards synchronize and only one device sends "PING" and the other sends "PONG" as a response.

To build the application, follow the steps outlined in the tutorial: [Using the Low-Level Sub-GHz Radio Driver for the STM32WL Series](https://forum.digikey.com/t/using-the-low-level-sub-ghz-radio-driver-for-the-stm32wl-series/18253). Then, simply replace the `main.c` in the project with one of the `main_xxxx.c` files in this repository (depending on which modulation scheme you want).
